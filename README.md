**Link to project:** https://dhhz19.github.io/cleaningServicesProj/L&JcleaningServices/

** project under development**

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node

I've built this project from scratch using HTML of the structure of the page and CSS for the styling. EJS and Node to build the backend and review protion of the page allowing the user to add reviews. So that when other users land on the page and are considering my clients services they can make a good decstion from the reviews! 

## Optimizations

I would optimize this project by adding a using a diffrent framework like React. This would allow me to create the project being component based allowing for a better development experince. I would also like to add a CSS framework like Bulma.

## Lessons Learned:
Buillding this project helped me realize that keeping a clean and scalable codebase is essintail for a succesful project.
